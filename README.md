## 📕 About

This website was created as a study challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

This was the first website that I developed, so my main objective with this challenge was to better understand how to use HTML and CSS in a real project.

## 🔨 Tools

- [HMTL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)

## 💻 Executing the Project

To execute the project in your computer:

```bash
# Clone the project
$ git clone https://github.com/MatricksRocha/QR-Code.git
```

Then:

```bash
# Just open the file "index.html" in your browser.
```
